# Publishing a Build to GitHub
In order to publish a build to GitHub you need two things:
- A GitHub release to publish to
- A release pipeline in Azure Pipelines

## Preparing a GitHub release

 1. Go to your GitHub repository and click the `0 release`link somewhere in the middle.
 2. Click `create a new release`.
 3. Enter a release number like `0.1.0.0` and select your `setup` branch (created in part 2).
 4. Give it a name like `Pipeline Release`, check `This is a pre-release` and click `Publish release`.

## Setting up a Manual Release Pipeline
In this section, we set up a manual release pipeline which publishes to the same tag.

 1. Go back to Azure Pipelines and click `Pipelines`->`Releases`.
 2. Click `New Pipeline`.
 3. Click `Empty job` rather than selecting a template.
 4. Click `Add an artifact`.
 5. Select the only entry in the `Source (build pipeline)` artifact, then change `Source alias`to the artifact name you picked in step 3. In this case `AndroidArtifact`. Click `Add`.
 6. In the `Stage 1` box, click the link `1 job, 0 task`.
 7. Change the stage name to e.g. `Publish to GitHub`, then click on the `+` sign in the `Agent job`panel.
 8. Select `Utility` and add a `GitHub Release` there.
 9. Click the new panel and adjust the following settings:
	 - Click `+ New`, then `Authorize using OAuth`.
	 - Select your repository.
	 - Set action to `Edit` (we already created the GitHub release).
	 - Enter the tag name you created a couple of minutes ago, e.g. `0.1.0.0`.
	 - Change `Assets` to `AndroidArtifact/*` (Use the name you assigned in step 5).
	 - Check `Pre-release`, then click `Save` and `OK`.
	 - Click on `+ Release`and `Create Release` and `Create`.
	 - Click on `Releases` in the left-hand panel.
	 - Once you see a green check mark next to `Publish to GitHub`, you can go to GitHub and you should see your signed APK file in the release you just created.

Once you're done verifying that you're satisfied with the APK (or uploaded it to an alpha release channel in Google Play Store), it's time to care about the desktop platforms.
